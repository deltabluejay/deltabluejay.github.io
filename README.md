## Development
Simply spin up the docker container:
```shell
docker-compose up
```

This container will detect any changes you make to the website files and automatically refresh the website as needed.

This website uses the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) Jekyll theme. See the [demo website](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) for documentation on how to use it.
