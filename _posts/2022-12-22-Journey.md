## Description
This challenge is from the internal BYU End-of-Semester CTF (Fall 2022).

```
There is a flag hiding somewhere on this site!! Looks like the site isn't very secure; they have some client-side authentication going on.
```

## Writeup
The provided link brought me to this site:

Reading through the dinosaur-related information given on the page didn't reveal anything that seemed important to finding the flag. 

The next thing I tried was inspecting the HTML, JS, and CSS files of the site via the Inspector, Debugger, and Style Editor tabs (respectively) of the browser inspector window. This did not reveal any pertinent information. However, the Storage tab revealed a cookie named `role`:

After trying to change the value of that cookie to achieve a different result with no success, I came to the conclusion that the cookie by itself was not enough information to complete the challenge. As a result, I started to search for more clues. Eventually, I had the idea to try guessing other paths of the site, such as `http://byuctf.xyz:40007/login` and `http://byuctf.xyz:40007/admin`, and eventually I found that `http://byuctf.xyz:40007/flag` brought me to this page:

This was key information: "Not authorized" was different from all of the "404 Not Found" errors I had been receiving from trying other paths that did not exist. Since the description of the challenge specified client-side authentication, I knew that the cookie I found earlier would be key to gaining authentication (since cookies store information client-side).

Taking a closer look at the cookie, I could see that it had a name of `role` and a value of `FD6C`. The value of `role` seemed like it should be something like `user` or `admin` describing the level of access a person has to a site. So what could `FD6C` mean?

I decided to plug in `FD6C` into the cipher identifier at [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) to see if it might be encoded somehow.

Analyzing it revealed a high likelihood of a ROT-47 cipher, so I followed its link to the ROT-47 page and decrypted the value there.

It turned out that `FD6C` is in fact a cipher for the word `user`. Following this chain of logic, I then used the same site to encode the word `admin` via ROT-47, resulting in the cipher text `25>:?`.

Then, back on the challenge website, I replaced the value of the cookie with `25>:?` and refreshed the page, revealing the desired flag:
