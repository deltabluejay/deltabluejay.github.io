## Writeup
As always, I first disassembled the binary in Ghidra, which resulted in the following `main` function:

![main function](main.png)
_`main` function_

At first glance, this seemed to take in input from the user and run the `do_line` function on it, which looked like this:

```c
void do_line(char *line)

{
  bool bVar1;
  bool bVar2;
  bool bVar3;
  size_t sVar4;
  char *__s1;
  char *pcVar5;
  int iVar6;
  char *opt;
  
  sVar4 = strlen(line);
  if (0 < (int)sVar4) {
    iVar6 = 0;
    bVar2 = false;
    bVar3 = false;
    pcVar5 = (char *)0x0;
    __s1 = line;
    do {
      bVar1 = (bool)(bVar3 | bVar2);
      if (bVar1) {
        if (*__s1 != '\0') {
          if (bVar3) {
            if ((*__s1 != ' ') && (pcVar5 = __s1, bVar3 = bVar2, bVar2)) {
              opt = line + iVar6;
              goto LAB_00101db7;
            }
          }
          else {
            opt = __s1;
            bVar2 = bVar1;
            if (*__s1 != ' ') goto LAB_00101cc7;
          }
        }
      }
      else {
        bVar2 = bVar1;
        bVar3 = bVar1;
        if (*__s1 == ' ') {
          if (pcVar5 == (char *)0x0) {
            *__s1 = '\0';
            bVar3 = true;
          }
          else {
            *__s1 = '\0';
            bVar2 = true;
          }
        }
      }
      iVar6 = iVar6 + 1;
      __s1 = __s1 + 1;
    } while ((int)sVar4 != iVar6);
    opt = (char *)0x0;
LAB_00101cc7:
    __s1 = pcVar5;
    if (__s1 != (char *)0x0) {
LAB_00101db7:
      iVar6 = get_number(line);
      if (iVar6 != 0) {
        return;
      }
      iVar6 = strcmp(__s1,"create");
      if (iVar6 == 0) {
        do_create(__s1,opt);
        return;
      }
      iVar6 = strcmp(__s1,"delete");
      if (iVar6 == 0) {
        do_delete(__s1,opt);
        return;
      }
      iVar6 = strcmp(__s1,"speak");
      if (iVar6 != 0) {
        iVar6 = strcmp(__s1,"rollover");
        if (iVar6 == 0) {
          do_rollover(__s1,opt);
          return;
        }
        iVar6 = strcmp(__s1,"debug");
        if (iVar6 != 0) {
          iVar6 = strcmp(__s1,"name");
          if (iVar6 == 0) {
            do_name(__s1,opt);
            return;
          }
          put("invalid cmd\n");
          return;
        }
        do_debug(__s1,opt);
        return;
      }
      do_speak(__s1,opt);
      return;
    }
  }
  puts("no command?");
  return;
}
```

It appeared to be some sort of command parser. Running the binary confirmed as much, but it seemed to want a very specific input in order to progress beyond "no command?".

![First run](run.png)

By playing around with the binary and by looking at the decompilation of `main`, `do_line` and some of the individaual command functions, I was able to determine that the program wanted input in this format:

```
<sequence number> <command> <args>
```

The sequence number needs to increment by one each time you send a command (but can start at any arbitrary value). The command is any command seen in `do_line`, and the required arguments vary by which command is being run. For example:

![Example commands](commands.png)

The available commands are as follows:
- `create <type>`: create a new pet of kind `type`
- `delete <i>`: delete the pet at index `i`
- `speak`: print status of all pets "speaking"
- `rollover`: print status of all pets "rolling over"
- `debug`: print some sort of "debug" data about each pet
- `name <i> <name>`: give name `name` to the pet at index `i`

Getting to this point comprised a significant portion of the time it took me to solve this challenge. There was a lot of code to look through, so (mostly) understanding what it did enough to use the program was a challenge.

However, once I knew what all the commands did, I knew it was likely that the bug was in the implementation of one of them. At first, the `delete` command stood out to me since I wanted to see if you could make it delete something it shouldn't be able to in order to cause a seg fault. I noticed that the mechanism for parsing the number from the string was custom made and did not use a C standard library function. Because of this, I discovered that it would let you input characters with values less than the ASCII numbers, like `/`, to cause the unsigned character value to roll over to `0xff`. However, after some more digging, I determined that this wasn't actually exploitable due to value checks later in the function.

![delete function](delete.png)
_`do_delete` function_

This then gave me the idea to look at any other commands that took `i` as an argument, since they would allow you to modify existing data perhaps in unintended ways. This left the `name` command:

```c
void do_name(char *cmd,char *opt)

{
  char cVar1;
  Pet *pPVar2;
  size_t sVar3;
  size_t sVar4;
  char *pcVar5;
  long lVar6;
  long lVar7;
  int x;
  undefined8 *puVar8;
  undefined8 *puVar9;
  uint uVar10;
  ulong uVar11;
  byte bVar12;
  
  bVar12 = 0;
  if (opt == (char *)0x0) {
    puts("missing option");
  }
  else {
    cVar1 = *opt;
    x = 0;
    lVar6 = 1;
    if ((byte)(cVar1 - 0x30U) < 10) {
      do {
        lVar7 = lVar6;
        x = cVar1 + -0x30 + x * 10;
        cVar1 = opt[lVar7];
        if (cVar1 == '\0') goto LAB_0010181c;
        lVar6 = lVar7 + 1;
      } while ((byte)(cVar1 - 0x30U) < 10);
      if (cVar1 == ' ') {
        puVar8 = (undefined8 *)(opt + lVar7 + 1);
        if (*(char *)puVar8 != '\0') {
          if (myList.n <= x) {
            put("you don\'t have that many pets\n");
            return;
          }
          pPVar2 = petlist::nth(&myList,x);
          if (pPVar2 == (Pet *)0x0) {
            return;
          }
          sVar3 = strlen((char *)puVar8);
          if (199 < sVar3) {
            return;
          }
          sVar4 = strlen(pPVar2->name);
          pcVar5 = pPVar2->name + sVar4;
          uVar11 = sVar3 + 1;
          uVar10 = (uint)uVar11;
          if (uVar10 < 8) {
            if ((uVar11 & 4) != 0) {
              *(undefined4 *)pcVar5 = *(undefined4 *)puVar8;
              *(undefined4 *)(pcVar5 + ((uVar11 & 0xffffffff) - 4)) =
                   *(undefined4 *)((long)puVar8 + ((uVar11 & 0xffffffff) - 4));
              return;
            }
            if (uVar10 == 0) {
              return;
            }
            *pcVar5 = *(char *)puVar8;
            if ((uVar11 & 2) == 0) {
              return;
            }
            *(undefined2 *)(pcVar5 + ((uVar11 & 0xffffffff) - 2)) =
                 *(undefined2 *)((long)puVar8 + ((uVar11 & 0xffffffff) - 2));
            return;
          }
          *(undefined8 *)pcVar5 = *puVar8;
          *(undefined8 *)(pcVar5 + ((uVar11 & 0xffffffff) - 8)) =
               *(undefined8 *)((long)puVar8 + ((uVar11 & 0xffffffff) - 8));
          lVar6 = (long)pcVar5 - (long)(undefined8 *)((ulong)(pcVar5 + 8) & 0xfffffffffffffff8);
          puVar8 = (undefined8 *)((long)puVar8 - lVar6);
          puVar9 = (undefined8 *)((ulong)(pcVar5 + 8) & 0xfffffffffffffff8);
          for (uVar11 = (ulong)(uVar10 + (int)lVar6 >> 3); uVar11 != 0; uVar11 = uVar11 - 1) {
            *puVar9 = *puVar8;
            puVar8 = puVar8 + (ulong)bVar12 * -2 + 1;
            puVar9 = puVar9 + (ulong)bVar12 * -2 + 1;
          }
          return;
        }
LAB_0010181c:
        put("missing name\n");
        return;
      }
    }
    put("bad number\n");
  }
  return;
}
```

As I was playing around with the `name` command, I noticed something odd- when you named a pet twice, rather than the pet adopting the new name in place of the old one, it just added on the new name to the original one:

![double name](names.png)

This gave me the thought to see how *long* I could make the second name. In looking at the Pet class structure, I could see that the `name` was initialized to a maximum of 200 characters. While the `do_name` function does check that the input name is less than 200 characters long, because it *adds* it onto the existing name, we can overflow the value to cause the program to attempt to modify a restricted area of memory.

_Vulnerable `do_name` code_

I tested this locally, and success- SIGSEGV!
