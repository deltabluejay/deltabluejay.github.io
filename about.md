I'm a student at Brigham Young University pursuing an undergraduate degree in cybersecurity. I am extremely passionate about my field of study and am always looking for chances to learn more. I enoy the thrill of being challenged, especially through CTFs and other cybersecurity competitions. I love cybersecurity because it is always changing and there's always more to learn to keep me on my feet and because it encourages thinking outside the box to solve (or find) problems.

You'll find me everywhere in the cybersecurity competition space under the handle "deltabluejay" and on the BYU Cyberia team.
