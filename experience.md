## Competitions
I often compete in various cyber competitions including CTFs and cyber defense competitions. I am an active member of the BYU CCDC team and contributor to our [public team resources](https://github.com/BYU-CCDC/public-ccdc-resources). I also compete regularly with the BYU Cyberia CTF team on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/team/155711) and in other CTFs individually. Any challenges I create or writeups I make covering how to solve certain challenges I found interesting will be posted here.
