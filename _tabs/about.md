I'm a student at Brigham Young University pursuing an undergraduate degree in cybersecurity. I love the fast-paced and creative aspect of the field which keeps me on my feet and encourages thinking outside the box to solve (or find) problems. Whether through my competitions, research, or work, I am always being challenged in new and exciting ways.

You'll find me everywhere in the cybersecurity competition space under the handle "deltabluejay" and on the BYU Cyberia team.
